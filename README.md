* Author: [@037](https://twitter.com/037)

This tool allows you to find available 3-character Reddit.com usernames. Usernames that appear as "AVAILABLE" can at times be banned, removed, or don't exit and are ready to use. This comes after an anonymous Reddit user used a bot to claim all 3-character username, this tool can be used to find if any remain.

### Prerequisites

The only thing you need installed is Python 3.x

```
apt-get install python3
```
